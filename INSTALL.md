Hello and welcome to our chess game!

Please follow these steps to run our game:
1. Make sure that OCaml is installed on your computer. Follow OS-dependent instructions here: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html
2. Then enter `opam install ANSITerminal` in your terminal to install the OPAM package required to run the game.
3. Download our source code and navigate to the root directory. Run `make build` to compile the source code.
4. Enter `make play` and the game will begin. You can type `help` at any point in the game to get a list of commands and their meaning. Enjoy!

*Note that for our Windows users, the chess piece icons would not render in the Ubuntu terminal. Therefore, we recommend running the game in an editor's terminal (VSCode worked perfect for us).*
